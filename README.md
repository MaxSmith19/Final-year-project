# Final-year-project

# Abstract
Small businesses play a crucial role in our economy, but many of these business
owners become vastly overwhelmed in the current world of ecommerce. A website
application was created to aid these business owners to optimize their
management and to continue expanding their businesses.

The work will host functions designed to help small businesses to grow. These
include financial account management, inventory tracking and social media
integration. By using this app, business owners can easily monitor their finances,
keep on track of their inventory, and monitor their social media accounts.
This application was also created with accessibility in mind, with a user-friendly
UX to ensure that the application can be used by everyone.

Whilst the effectiveness of our application has yet to be proven, this application
was created with usersâ€™ own requirements in mind, by meeting these expectations,
we anticipate that this solution will provide enough support to help simplify the
difficulties associated with business management.

Overall, this application was created with small business owners as its foundation
and given some additional professional changes, it will be very successful in aiding
business management for small enterprises.

# Summary

This project utilises the MERN stack to create a website that would allow small businesses to manage their finances, inventory, social media in one easy application.
Research into pre-existing solutions proved that there was a large opening for this type of application.

This application was then tested using Functional tests, unit tests and performance tests and was set up to also be white-boxed alpha testing with some stakeholders that were interested in using the application.
However, a large memory leak was found, meaning that the frontend could not be hosted on Heroku as intended and that the alpha tests could not be completed.

I absolutely loved this project, from the research all the way to the testing; it made me much more confident in my JavaScript skills and showcased what I could teach myself in a short amount of time. ( I did not know REACT prior to this project )
